            Nursery workers are like caring parents who don’t mind getting their hands dirty to make sure their plants thrive. Nursery work is both a labor of love and labor intensive. Nursery workers find themselves in a greenhouse or outdoors in all weather conditions. Lifting, shoveling, digging, cutting, pruning, and planting are part of the game. They log lots of hours on their knees with their hands in the dirt.
            Most nurseries focus on certain types plants – those that they think will sell. This may mean flowers, ornamental shrubbery, fruit trees, saplings, or exotic flowers. Typically this is a seasonal business with the most work occurring during the growing and planting seasons in spring and fall.</p>
