            <p id="p1">Nurseries grow plants in open fields, on container fields, in tunnels or greenhouses. <br>
            In open fields, nurseries grow decorative trees, shrubs and herbaceous perennials. <br>
            On a containerfield nurseries grow small trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants, <br>
            usually destined for sales in garden centers. These have proper ventilation, sunlight etc. <br>
            Plants may be grown by seed(s). The most common method is by cutting plants/plant cuttings. <br>
            These can be taken from shoot tips or from roots etc. By these methods plants are grown <br>in nurseries and gardens
            A nursery is a place where plants are propagated and grown to a <br> desired age. They include retail nurseries which sell to the general public,
            wholesale nurseries which <br> sell only to businesses such as other nurseries and to commercial gardeners, and private nurseries<br> 
            which supply the needs of institutions or private estates.<br>
            Nurseries may supply plants for gardens, agriculture, forestry and conservation biology.<br>
